How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I'm not sure how much this project improved my programming skills, though it did help me remember the value of modular code in ensuring adaptability and readability.  However, it did give me a great opportunity to exercise my meager art skills.  I think it can be too easy to overlook the importance of aesthetics in adding value to a project.  Because the project involved a number of specific objects, I was able to work through them sequentially, and was able to apply slightly more sophistication to the desgin of each new object.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The final project was the result of half a dozen iterations of the visualization program, as it slowly developed through each of the milestones.  Each of the objects in the scene were also the result of many iterations as I slowly tweaked them to look as much like their real-life counterparts as I could manage.  There was quite a bit of trial and error invovled!

Overall, this project emphasized the value of regularly testing and refining my code.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Professionally, computational graphics and visualization provide me an avenue to improve the comprehensibility of the data analysis I conduct.  Making large datasets easy visualize and digest is an extremely valuable skill in many modern business enterprises.

Educationally, I'm not quite sure how computational graphics will be applied just yet, though this course did give me a lot of opportunities to exercise my problem solving and troubleshooting skills.
